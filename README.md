# The Mule ‚Äî Personal Project (Avalonia .NET, MVVM) for Printed T-Shirts  
**Printify ‚Üí Shopify** semi-automation desktop tool

**The Mule** is a **personal project**: an Avalonia desktop app (MVVM) that streamlines a **printed T-shirt** workflow. It generates mock product images and items via the **Printify API**, and can (optionally) create the **matching Shopify products** that use those images.

## ‚ú® Why / Scope (T-Shirt Focus)

This tool is opinionated toward **printed T-shirts**:
- Step-by-step flow to generate **mock images** for a design across common **sizes/variants** (e.g., S‚ÄìXXL, multiple colors where supported)
- Batch creation of **Printify items** using those mockups
- **Optional** posting of **Shopify products** that reference the generated assets

The goal: turn a multi-step, error-prone process into a **guided desktop workflow** with clear progress and diagnostics.
